# E-Commerce 

I created this whole app using react vite for frontend and tailwind css for it's UI. And it is moblie responnsive as well.

I used the fakestore.api for backend after adding crud operations within it. I deploy it on render.

I implemented contex for state management and useCookie for jwt-authentication.
